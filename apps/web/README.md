# Voca Web App

This is the official web client for [Voca](https://voca.vc), built with SvelteKit.

It serves as both:
1. A production-ready voice chat application
2. A reference implementation for the `@treyorr/voca-client` and `@treyorr/voca-svelte` SDKs

See the [main README](../../README.md) for full project documentation.
